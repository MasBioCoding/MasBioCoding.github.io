I study interdisciplinary studies with a major in biology. I love thinking about living systems from the perspective of science. First and foremost biological systems are boundless and not open to understanding. It is interesting to learn how science justifies simplyfying systems into things, how placing bounds on what a thing is and what can be known about it increases knowledge. So far rather than reduce my sensitivity to complexity, I feel science actually has increased it, be it in confusing ways.
