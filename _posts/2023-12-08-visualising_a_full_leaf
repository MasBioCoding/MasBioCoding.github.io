# Visualising a full leaf

Have you ever looked at a leaf and wondered about it's cellular structures?
Have you ever been teased into this feeling of not fully understanding a plant?
Most animals run away, giving you pleanty reason not to know them intimately. But plan't can't hide,
yet still the must peak you curiosity. Have you ever sat in front of a leaf and strained your eyes to see inside?
With a microscope, you might gain insight, but you lose perspective. Peering into the binoculars, the sense of scale disappears.
After an initial wonder, a new wave of curiosity arises, and the only answer would surely be to increase the magnification.
Deeper still lies the mystery.

This can go on and on and everytime we gain something, but we also leave behind the world we knew. And looking back at the full leaf,
we feel only more wonder, but no satisfaction. In this project I am trying to marry the world we know, to the world too small to see.
I want you to have acces to the leaf in it's entirety without distinction from it's cellular composition.
Image stitching and focus stacking allow for this. I have created a single large image composed of hundreds of photo's.
This allows you to zoom in to any part of the leaf and see it's cells, while at the same time keeping the perspective of the leaf
as a whole. Go ahead and try:

Focus stacking is taking many photographs at different focal lengths to create a single image that is sharp everywhere.

Image stitching is taking many photographs that overlap, so that a software can stitch them together into a bigger image.
